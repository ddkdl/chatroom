# Branch Rules

**Master Branch**
The master branch will be the most stable version of the software. Imagine it as a final product release.
DO NOT COMMIT DIRECTLY TO MASTER!

The only way to make changes to master should be by creating a pull request from development only.

**development**
The development branch will have a working version of the project that is currently being worked on.
Ideally, commiting to this branch is fine as long as the commits consist of changes that will not break the code in any way. For those types of changes, branch from  development, make the change, and then make a pull request to the development branch.
