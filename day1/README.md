# Day One - Getting Started with Go

## Tasks

### Hello World!

As any good programming tutorial, we will start with a hello world program to get a hang of what are the minimum requirements for running a program.

### Hello You!

As any good programming tutorial, we will beat a dead horse again and again to get a point accross.
This time we will modify the Hello World program to take in user input and display in on the screen.

### Loan Payment Calculator

We will build a calculator for estimating the monthly payments of a loan.

This estimation is based on the [Loan Amortization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortized_loan.asp) principle. Where given a **principal loan amount (P)**, an **interest rate (r)**, the **number of yearly payments (n)**, and the **loan term (t)** we can estimate the **monthly payment amount (p)** and the **total amount paid with interest (I)** with the following formula:

## Smart Rhymer

We will now build a program for identifying whether two words rhyme or not.

Unlike the name suggests, this is not a very smart program. It only recognizes words that end with the same 3 letters as rhyming (If you want to make it into a smarter program feel free to try :)).
