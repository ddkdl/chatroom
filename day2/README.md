# Day Two - Picking Up The Pace

## Tasks

### Estimate the Area Under a Curve

One of the many uses of integration is to find the area under a curve. But prior to integration, the [Riemann sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum) approximation was used for estimating the area under a curve. 

We will write a program that estimates the area under a curve.


### Print Prime Numbers Between 2 and n

Prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by themselves and 1. Composite numbers are those that are composed of prime numbers. This interesting property of prime numbers make them a very useful tool to use in engineering. For instance, modern cryptographic schemes such as [RSA](https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/rsa-encryption/) rely heavily on prime number factorization.

For this task we will do something much simpler. We will print all prime numbers between 2 and n, where n is up to the user's discretion.

We will implement the basic divisibility method first and then we will implement the [sieve of Eratostenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes).

### Calculate Factorial of n

We will write two functions that calculates the factorial of a number. One will be [recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)) and the other one will be iterative.

### Monte Carlo Aproximation of Pi

[Monte Carlo methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) are a class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. There is a variety of applications of these methods ranging from performing integration to weather forecasting.

In this task, we will attempt to approximate the value of our favorite number, pi, using a Monte Carlo approach.
