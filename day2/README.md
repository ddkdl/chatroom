### Estimate the Area Under a Curve

One of the many uses of integration is to find the area under a curve. But prior to integration, the [Riemann sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum) approximation was used for estimating the area under a curve. 

Today we will write a program that estimates the area under a curve using Riemann sum.
